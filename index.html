        <p id="words">  I'm Elizabeth Fox, a graduate from Georgia State University, and from Conyers, Ga. Currently I work at Ultimate Software as a Technical Consultant. My favorite season is football   season. Go Falcons! While in college I got an internship at the NFL which led to incredible opportunities to work at Ga State's football games, Chick-fil-A Kickoff games and Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl. The highlight of this year was being able to work at the 2018 College Championship game.<br>My favorite hobby is baking. While in college I worked in the Publix bakery as a cake decorator. I'm now the designated birthday cake maker in my family. My niece and nephew love being able to "place their order", which makes it worth the work.
